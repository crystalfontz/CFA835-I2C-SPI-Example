 # Crystalfontz CFA835 Module I2C / SPI Communications Arduino Example
 
 This example is designed to run on a Seeeduino v4.2 development board.  
 It should also run on an Arduino Uno with minimal (or no) changes.  

 This example may also work with other Crystalfontz Intelligent packet based
 displays that use an I2C / SPI interface, but it has not been tested as yet.
